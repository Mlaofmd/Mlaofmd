### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Mlaofmd is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SLIMIUM
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP, Python, Haxe (for FNF shits lmao), C++, C# and Lua
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about My name is Victor and I love touch grass lmao
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: idk
